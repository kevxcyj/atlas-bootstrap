Atlas Bootstrap — Kamen Rider Showcase

About the Developer

Hi, I’m Kevin Cyrus Jr. — a passionate web developer who loves blending creativity with code. I have a strong interest in tokusatsu, especially the Kamen Rider series, which inspired me to build this project.

This project represents my love for storytelling through design and my journey of learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

- Project Description -

Atlas Bootstrap is a visual showcase of every Kamen Rider across different eras — from Showa to Heisei to Reiwa. The goal is to create a stylish, responsive website that honors decades of legendary heroes while also sharpening my web development skills.

The site features carefully organized sections, character highlights, and an evolving gallery of riders. Inspired by my childhood love for the Kamen Rider franchise, I wanted to build something that feels both nostalgic and modern.

- Development Story -

Building this project was both exciting and challenging:

I started with a basic HTML/CSS layout, then transitioned to Bootstrap for a cleaner, responsive design.

Organizing decades’ worth of characters was tricky, but I enjoyed curating and displaying them in a meaningful way.

The biggest learning moment was mastering Bootstrap components — grids, cards, navbars, and responsive images — to create a fluid experience across devices.

This project is as much a love letter to Kamen Rider as it is a milestone in my journey as a developer.
